 * OPTIMIZATION: this whole module holds a lot of potential for optimization.
 * Typical runtimes are 15-30ms which is okay due to the infrequency of
 * users actually joining rooms. The fact that all calls are async helps as well
 * since we are not blocking other incoming calls or db calls. Only once there
 * is a considerable number of users will this module begin to be a limiting factor.
 * Though increased database sized might make this happen sooner rather than later.
 *
 * In any case, I'm marking it for optimization for future me. Hi future Ian!
 * I hope this code doesn't make you cringe too hard :p
